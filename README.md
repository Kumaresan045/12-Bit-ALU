# 12-Bit-ALU
1. This project is implementation of a 12-bit ALU capable of performing integer and floating point arithmetic.
2. There is a Register file consisting of 8 12-bit registers , 2 read ports, and 1 write port capable of storing integer and floating point numbers.
3. To test the working, change the input values in the testbench file.
4. To see the output, run the command given in compilecmd.txt in the terminal.
